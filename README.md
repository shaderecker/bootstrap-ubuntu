Playbook for keeping track of my Laptop/PC Ubuntu Configuration

This is WIP as I don't recall every step I made in the past for my current setup (manual work, buuh).  
As I introduce new config changes to my systems, they will be added here.

Also, should I set up one of my systems completely from scratch in the future, I will put every step here in this playbook.

**Plz remember future me**

As baseline Ubuntu (20.04) is installed in "Minimal Install" mode.
